    These Ranges are important.
    Ques:-  Range of Int ?
    Ans :-  approximate Range of int is -2 * 10^9   to    2 * 10^9.
    
    Ques:-  Range of Long ?
    Ans :-  approximate Range of long is -9 * 10^18   to    9 * 10^18.

    As long as we remember the approximate range then we don't need to remember actual value.

### Modulo Operator  {%}
``` 
    this is know as Modulas operator.
    It gives us Remainder.
    It is useful Mathmatical operator.
    
    Equation:-
            Dividend = Divisor * Quotient + Remainder.
            
            We are finding Remainder, we have given Divisor & Dividend. 
            eg:- 
                10 % 4. 
                 Dividend = Divisor * Quotient + Remainder.
                    10    =     4   *    ?     +    ?     .
                           Quotient is basically 10/4, means the integer value of that. 
                           for Remainder is r.
                    Simplify:-
                        10 = 4 * {Integer Division of 10/4} + r         
                        10 = 4 * 2 + r
                        10 = 8 + r
                        r = 2     
                    In computer if we do 10 % 4 then result is 2.
            So, basically given a Divisor & Dividend we have to find the Remainder that is Modulo do.
