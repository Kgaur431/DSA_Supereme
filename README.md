### ALGORIGHTM
1. WHAT IS ALGORIGHTM?
````
    ANS --> STEPS, that we perform to complete a task.
    REMEMBER --> TO COMPLETE A PARTICULAR TASK, THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS TO SOLVE 1 PROBLEM. 
````
2. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY DATA STRUCTURE ?
````
    ANS --> HOW WE ORGANISE OUR DATA.
   2.1 WHAT GOAL DO WE HAME IN MIND TO STORE THE DATA.
        ANS -->   
        QUES --> WHAT IS THE POSSIBILITY TO WHERE WE FIND THE UTENSILS ?

                          **to make ease of data.** || **efficiency of working with data.**
  
````
### **So any data structure we choose is always chosen by keeping in mind if it is suitable for my usecase.**
3. WHAT IS THE FIRST STEPS TOWARD PROBLEM-SOLVING ?
    1. UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM.
    2. ANALYSING THE PROBLEM. means, we have to **MAKE OBSERVATION TO SOLVE PROBLEM**
